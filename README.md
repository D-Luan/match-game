# Match Game (Head First C#)

A mini-project based on the book Head First C# 4th Edition.

A mini-project to understand the fundamentals of C# and WPF. This game consists of an interface with animal emojis, where the user clicks to find a pair. Each pair found disappears from the interface; the player must complete the game by finding all the pairs, with a timer to determine how long it takes to find them.
